		<button class="faq-item-question" onclick="w3.toggleShow('#q5')">>Do I need to be a professional cook or tour guide?</button>
		<div id="q5" style="display:none">
				<p>Citizen Guide is open for everyone. We’re always happy to welcome foodies with a passion for cooking, love for their local area or a specific skill for your community.

		<button class="faq-item-question" onclick="w3.toggleShow('#q6')">>How do I calculate the right price for my experience?</button>
		<div id="q6" style="display:none">
				<p>Think about what you want to receive, what is a fair price for your experience? Take into consideration the time and effort you will put in as well as any extra elements such as ingredients for dinner, gas, entrance tickets etc.
<br><br>
You determine the price yourself. The Citizen Guide 20% fee is automatically calculated and deducted from the total price. So suppose you offer a home dinner for $10, the Citizen Guide fee will be $2. For ease we directly withdraw this fee, so you’ll receive $8 through your preferred payment method.
<br><br>
We ask you not to display your experiences for a lower price on other websites than Citizen Guide. We’re an open marketplace so price competition between hosts in the same area is likely.</p>
